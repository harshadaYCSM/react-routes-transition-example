# React Routes Transition Example

This project demonstrates how to implement smooth transitions between routes in a React application using React Router and the `react-transition-group` library. The example showcases animated transitions that enhance user experience during navigation.

## Features

- Smooth transitions between routes.
- Easy to extend and customize animations.
- Uses `react-transition-group` for robust animations.
- Demonstrates setup with React Router.

## Getting Started

- npm (version 6 or later) or yarn (version 1.22 or later)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/harshadaYCSM/react-routes-transition-example.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

  bash
   cd react-routes-transition-example
   

3. Install the dependencies:

   Using npm:

   npm install

   Or using yarn:

   yarn install

### Running the Application

To start the development server and run the application locally, use the following command:

Using npm:

npm start

Or using yarn:

yarn start

Open your browser and navigate to \`http://localhost:3000\` to see the application in action.

### Building for Production
