# React Routes Transition Example

This project demonstrates how to implement smooth transitions between routes in a React application using React Router and the `react-transition-group` library. The example showcases animated transitions that enhance user experience during navigation.

## Features

- Smooth transitions between routes.
- Easy to extend and customize animations.
- Uses `react-transition-group` for robust animations.
- Demonstrates setup with React Router.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 12 or later)
- npm (version 6 or later) or yarn (version 1.22 or later)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   \`\`\`bash
   git clone https://github.com/harshadaYCSM/react-routes-transition-example.git
   \`\`\`

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   \`\`\`bash
   cd react-routes-transition-example
   \`\`\`

3. Install the dependencies:

   Using npm:

   \`\`\`bash
   npm install
   \`\`\`

   Or using yarn:

   \`\`\`bash
   yarn install
   \`\`\`

### Running the Application

To start the development server and run the application locally, use the following command:

Using npm:

\`\`\`bash
npm start
\`\`\`

Or using yarn:

\`\`\`bash
yarn start
\`\`\`

Open your browser and navigate to \`http://localhost:3000\` to see the application in action.

### Building for Production

To create a production build of the application, use the following command:

Using npm:

\`\`\`bash
npm run build
\`\`\`

Or using yarn:

\`\`\`bash
yarn build
\`\`\`

This will create a \`build\` directory with the production files.

- \`src/\`: Contains the source code for the React application.
    - \`components/\`: Contains the React components for different routes.
    - \`styles/\`: Contains the CSS files for styling, including transitions.
    - \`App.js\`: The main component that sets up the router and transitions.
    - \`index.js\`: The entry point of the React application.
    - \`routes.js\`: Defines the routes for the application.

## Customizing Transitions

The transitions are defined in the CSS file located at \`src/styles/transitions.css\`. You can customize the animations by modifying the CSS classes.
